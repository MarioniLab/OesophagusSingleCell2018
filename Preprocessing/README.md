# Computational processing of raw data

This folder contains scripts for quality filtering, normalization and per-batch processing (e.g. tSNE computation, clustering and marker gene extraction).
The Full_data_batch_correction and Full_data_batch_correction_allSamples scripts furthermore perform batch correction across high-quality and all samples.
The Tissue_correction script performs batch correction across single tissues and clusters the corrected counts.
