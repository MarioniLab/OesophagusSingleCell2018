# OesophagusSingleCell2018

Code for the single-cell project on tissues of the upper GI.
In this repository, the nomenclature for tissue types is as follows:

NE – Normal oEsophagus
BE – Barrett’s oEsophagus
GC – Normal Gastric Cardia
SMG – Oesophageal Submucosal Glands
D2 – Normal Duodenum
GOJ – squamo-columnar junction between NE and NG
SCJ – squamo-columnar junction between NE and BE

This nomenclature is somewhat different from the one used in the associated publication.
